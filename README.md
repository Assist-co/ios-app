## Summary
We're building a service that matches our users (clients) with their own personal assistants. A client can use our mobile app to easily interface with their assigned assistant while on the go. Assistants can perform tasks including but not limited to making calls, sending emails, scheduling meetings, making purchases, and conducting general research. Our app keeps track of tasks and provides convenient ways to communicate with one's assistant, including voice-to-text functionality.

## Target Audience
Now more than ever, professionals and millenials are outsourcing many of their day-to-day tasks to services like Instacart, Washio, Task Rabbit, Munchery, and Door Dash. A premium has been placed on reclaiming time from menial activities. We feel that there is an ample market for people who either do not need or cannot afford a full time secretary yet would benefit from the outsourcing of secretarial tasks. Providing a mobile solution to this problem allows us to allocate one secretary accross multiple people who do not need the fulltime services of a secretary.
